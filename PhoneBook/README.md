# Phonebook Mini App

# Description

The Phonebook Mini App is a simple command-line application built in Python that allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. Users can add, edit, delete, and display contacts stored in a SQLite database. This project serves as an excellent introduction to basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a database, as well as a way to practice object-oriented programming concepts in Python.

# Features

Create Contact: Add new contacts with their name, phone number, and optional email address.
Edit Contact: Update existing contact details using the phone number as a unique identifier.
Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the phonebook using their phone number.
Display Contacts: View all contacts stored in the phonebook in a clear format.

# Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
SQLite: A lightweight database engine for storing contact information.
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Employed to create a structured and modular codebase.

# Installation

    git clone https://github.com/Behailu-Sileshi/python-mini-projects.git
    cd python-mini-projects/phonebook

Create a Data Directory: Ensure you have a data directory where the SQLite database will be stored:

    mkdir data

Run the Application: Execute the app.py script to start the application:
    python app.py

# Usage
